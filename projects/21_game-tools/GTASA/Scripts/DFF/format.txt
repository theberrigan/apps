- Pipeline Set        0x0253F2F3
  https://gtamods.com/wiki/Pipeline_Set_(RW_Section)
  The section only consists of an 4-byte integer which can have one of three different values.
  This value will determine which of the engine's rendering pipeline to use for an atomic.
  - 0x53F20098 – Render pipeline used for buildings with reflective materials.
  - 0x53F2009A – Render pipeline used for vehicles.
  - 0x53F2009C – Render pipeline used for night vertex colors.
  For example if the data is 0x53F2009A a specular material can be added to a non-vehicle object.
  Primarily this is used for vehicle upgrade parts and some cutscene objects.
  Vehicles are using this rendering pipeline by default and do not need a pipeline set.
  It is not possible to add specular or reflective materials to a player, pedestrian or other 'skinned' models.
- Specular Material   0x0253F2F6
  https://gtamods.com/wiki/Specular_Material_(RW_Section)
  Clump > Geometry List > Geometry > Material List > Material > Extension > Specular Material.
  In GTA San Andreas it is used to store material information for specular lighting.
  To use a specular material, the rendering pipeline that is responsible for rendering the object must support specular materials.
  This is true by default for vehicles, but not for buildings.
  To hook specularity into the rendering pipeline, the pipeline extion for the geometries atomic needs to be changed.
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  | 4b - FLOAT    - Specular Level (0.0-1.0)         |
  |24b - CHAR[24] - Specular Texture Name, see below |
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  On the PC and Xbox versions of the game a specular texture is not used.
  On the PS2 however, it is used as a second reflection map.
  The string is null terminated, and aligned to 4 byte boundaries with extra zeros appended.
- 2d Effect           0x0253F2F8
  https://gtamods.com/wiki/2d_Effect_(RW_Section)
  Clump > Geometry List > Geometry > Extension > 2d Effect
  There can be multiple effects per section, their types are defined by an ID.
  A 2d Effect section starts with a 4 byte DWORD which is the number of 2d Effect entries that follow.
  ...
- Extra Vertex Colour 0x0253F2F9
- Collision Model     0x0253F2FA
- Reflection Material 0x0253F2FC
- Breakable           0x0253F2FD
- Frame               0x0253F2FE
