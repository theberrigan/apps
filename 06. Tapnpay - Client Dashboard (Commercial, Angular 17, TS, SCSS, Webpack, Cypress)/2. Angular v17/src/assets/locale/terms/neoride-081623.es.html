            use of a credit card, debit card, or other payment methods that may be made available to you via third
            party payment processors (each, a <strong>“Payment Processor”</strong>) by neoRide from time to time (which may include
            Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other payment processors). You may be given an option for a primary method of
            payment (<strong>“Primary Method”</strong>) and asked for a secondary method of payment (<strong>“Secondary Method”</strong>).
            If a payment for Tolls or other Service-related fees via your Primary Method fails, then neoRide will
            request you provide a Secondary Method for the applicable Toll or Charges.

            or a transponder (toll tag) to your Account to identify Toll transactions sent by ATFOs and OTSPs (b)
            you will review and authorize payment of your neoRide Invoice incurred through one of the Payment Methods,
            and (c) neoRide will pay the Tolls and or Charges on your behalf to the ATFO or OTSP. Your use of Payment Methods
            is subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the applicable Payment Processor (a  <strong>“Payment Processor Agreement”</strong>).

        <strong>1.4	Eligible Coverage</strong>
        <p>

            at neoride.com website, in the https://TapNPay.biz website, and in the neoRide mobile application.
            When referencing your neoRide account, notice coverage will be outlined by license plate.  Not all toll agencies
            allow neoRide to pay tolls on your behalf.  For this reason, neoRide toll payment services may not work in all
            outlined locations.  You agree that neoRide is not responsible for tolls charged to you when using non-covered
            toll roads or other transportation provider services.  Partial toll road coverage is possible should you have
            a predefined toll payment method in one state but choose to register for neoRide coverage for all other Eligible Coverage areas.

        agreement between you and any ATFO or OTSP; and (c) it does not give you any rights or remedies against or
        with respect to an ATFO or OTSPs. You further expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement
        modifies any rights or responsibilities you may have with respect to the payment of Tolls, administrative fees,
        or any other charges for which you are liable to an ATFO or OTSPs under applicable law. Under applicable law, the
        registered owner of a vehicle that uses an ATFO’s toll facility is liable for payment to the AFTO of a Toll. Subject
        to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, neoRide agrees to pay the Toll or other transportation service Charges,
        on your behalf to the applicable ATFO or OTSP, but if neoRide fails or is not obligated under this Agreement to pay
        the Toll or Charge, the registered owner of the vehicle that incurs the Toll or Charge will remain liable to the ATFO
        or OTSPs to pay the Toll or Charge and any administrative fees or other charges resulting from a failure to pay the
        Toll or Charge within the payment period provided by law. You irrevocably agree not to pursue against an ATFO or OTSP
        any claim, cause of action, or other remedy available to you for or arising out of or in connection with neoRide’s
        failure to comply with this Agreement, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that no ATFO or OTSPs shall be liable
        for any failure or default by neoRide under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 2 impairs any claims or other
        rights you may have against neoRide for its failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

    <ul>
        <strong>7.1. Rates; Payment of Subscription Fee</strong>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise stated during a promotion period, you agree to pay a non-refundable subscription fee, (to be
            determined at time of registration) to establish your Account (the <strong>“Subscription Fee”</strong>). The Subscription Fee is an annual
            recurring charge and will be processed using your self-designated Account Payment Method. In the event your designated
            payment method cannot be charged, you will receive a text message with an invoice link. Tolls and Charges are assessed
            according to the applicable ATFO’s and other transportation service provider’s rate schedule plus a service fee (ranging
            from 15% to 30% depending on toll agency and road services utilized, per transaction (a “Service Fee”) in effect at the
            time of the transaction, which is available on the ATFO’s or OTSP’s website or at the ATFO’s or OTSP’s Customer Service
            Centers. ATFOs and neoRide reserve the right to change their toll rates, fees, and charges at any time, and you agree
            that your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to pay the revised rates, fees, and charges as reimbursement
            to neoRide. neoRide, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with incentives to any of our customers.
            These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your use of the Service. Additionally, new promotional
            offers may not be available to you unless and until you have fully used any discounts available to you under promotional
            offers you have already elected to use.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>7.2. Postpaid Invoicing; Approval</strong>
        <p>
            All Tolls and Charges processed, assessed, and transmitted by the ATFO or OTSPs to neoRide for an LPN in a given day
            will be invoiced to your Account on the following business day. When you have chosen to utilize the postpaid payment solution,
            neoRide will group all Tolls and/or Charges processed by the ATFO or other transportation service providers for all LPNs
            linked to a single Account into a single daily invoice. You will receive a text (SMS) message with a link where you will
            be able to review the invoice, including individual transactions, and agree to pay or dispute the charges. Once you receive
            the electronic invoice notification via SMS you will have <strong>24 hours</strong> to reject or approve the invoice. Approved charges for
            applicable Service Fees will be charged to your self-designated Payment Method. <strong>All payments (including the Subscription Fee)
            are final and non-refundable.</strong> Failure to resolve the invoice by approval or dispute of any and all charges for any LPN associated
            with your Account within 24 hours may result in termination or suspension your ability to use the Service with respect to all
            LPN’s associated with your Account.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>7.2.1 Prepaid Top Up Approval</strong>
        <p>
            When you have chosen to utilize the prepaid payment solution, your payment method of choice will be charged an upfront amount as
            your account balance.  All Tolls and Charges processed, assessed, and transmitted by the ATFO or other transportation service
            providers to neoRide for a registered LPN associated to your account in a given day will be invoiced to your Account on the following
            business day. Tolls and Charges will be debited from your account balance on file with neoRide. When your neoRide account balance
            has reached the designated low balance threshold, neoRide will automatically charge the requested top-up amount designated by you
            during account registration.  If there is an error processing the top-up transaction using your payment method on file, neoRide
            will send you a text (SMS) message or email with a link to update your payment method, If your payment method is not updated
            within 24 hours of notice, your neoRide account will be placed on HOLD.  If your account balance is not replenished within 5 days,
            all outstanding unpaid invoices will be sent to a collection agency for billing.  <strong>All payments (including the Subscription Fee) are
            final and non-refundable.</strong> If you identify Tolls or Charges to have been made to your account in error, the TapNPay and neoRide Service
            will allow you to dispute the charge accordingly.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>7.3 Disputes</strong>
        <p>
            If you dispute some of the Tolls on an invoice or prepaid account balance, you will be prompted to indicate the reason for your rejection(s)
            by selecting the reason that best describes the reason for your rejection(s). For certain dispute types, you may be asked to provide documentation
            such as a Vehicle Transfer Notice (VTN) or Bill of Sale when the vehicle has been sold, court papers for declared bankruptcy, or police report
            for a stolen vehicle. The foregoing list is illustrative only and does not limit the information and documentation an ATFO may require with
            respect to a disputed Toll. You hereby represent and warrant that all information you submit in connection with an invoice or prepaid account
            balance dispute is true and correct. Information you submit in connection with your dispute will be sent to the appropriate ATFO(s) for review.
            If you dispute ALL or more than 10% of your collective tolls on an invoice, neoRide reserves the right to deactivate your Account until ATFO
            finalizes its review of your requested disputes. Subject to the ATFO’s business rules, you may still receive an invoice from neoRide or the ATFO
            for Tolls you dispute. If the ATFO determines, in its sole discretion, that your dispute is invalid or cannot be accepted, you will remain
            obligated to pay the Toll charge.
        </p>

    <ul>
        <strong>7.4 Mobile Carrier Fees</strong>

            in advance of such fees (through email, SMS the TapNPay Site, or the neoRide Mobile Application) and given the opportunity to opt-out of, or
            decline to sign up for, the Service to avoid paying the fee(s). neoRide may pass-through fees imposed by Carriers that have been appropriately
            disclosed and agreed to by you before such fees are charged.

            SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY,
            EVEN IF TAPNPAY OR NEORIDE OR YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.2.</strong>
            EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 12 BELOW AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF TAPNPAY
            OR NEORIDE AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY
            TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE
            GREATER OF: (A) TOLLS PAID BY YOU IN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.3.</strong>
            EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES,
            OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS
            ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND
            INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.3 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED
            REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.4.</strong>
            No arbitration, action, suit, proceeding, claim, counterclaim, or crossclaim arising under or relating to this Agreement
            may be brought more than two years after the later of the first event giving rise thereto or the date when neoRide or you
            with reasonable diligence could have discovered the pertinent facts. If any applicable law does not allow the claims limitation
            period to be two years, then the period for the filing of any claim shall be the shortest period or periods allowed by such law.
        </p>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <strong>12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.1. Generally</strong>
        <p>
            In the interest of resolving disputes between you and neoRide in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described
            in Section 12.2, you and neoRide agree that every dispute arising between you and neoRide in connection with this Agreement will be
            resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of
            a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
            can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims between you and
            neoRide arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation,
            or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
            AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND neoRide ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.2. Exceptions</strong>
        <p>
            Despite the provisions of Section 12.1, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right
            of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal,
            state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to
            file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. Also, as provided in Section 2, nothing in this
            Agreement, including, but not limited to, this Section 12, is binding on or creates obligations or limitations with respect to an ATFO or OTSPs.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.3. Arbitrator</strong>
        <p>
            Any arbitration between you and neoRide will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by
            the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, <strong>“AAA Rules”</strong>)
            as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879,
            or by contacting neoRide. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
            or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.4. Notice of Arbitration; Process</strong>
        <p>
            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified
            U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by
            electronic mail (<strong>“Notice of Arbitration”</strong>). neoRide’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Neology Inc, 1917 Palomar Oaks Way,
            Suite 110, Carlsbad, CA. 92008.The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b)
            set forth the specific relief sought (<strong>“Demand”</strong>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the
            parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or neoRide may commence an
            arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
            During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or neoRide must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
            arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount
            offered by neoRide in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, neoRide will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator
            or (ii) $10,000.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.5. Fees</strong>
        <p>
            If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, neoRide will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim
            is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a
            location to be agreed upon in San Diego County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will
            be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c)
            by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either
            the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards
            set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree
            to reimburse neoRide for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of
            the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
            findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
            payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
            arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.6. No Class Actions</strong>
        <p>
            YOU AND neoRide AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
            MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and neoRide agree otherwise, the arbitrator
            may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>
        <p>
            If neoRide makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TapNPay’s or neoRide address for Notice of Arbitration,
            you may reject the change by sending neoRide written notice within 30 days of the change to TapNPay’s or neoRide’s  address for Notice
            of Arbitration, in which case your account with neoRide will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
            prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <strong>12.8. Enforceability</strong>
        <p>
            If Section 12.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
            Section 12 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14.2
            will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.
        </p>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <strong>13. ATFO Enforcement Rights</strong>
    <ul>
        NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING SECTIONS 7.3, 11 and 12, SHALL BIND THE ATFO OR OTSP TO THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS SET FORTH HEREIN

            any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout this Agreement the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”.
            This Agreement has been prepared in English; if you have received a copy of this Agreement translated into any other language, such translation is
            provided for convenience only and the English version shall control. If any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
            the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
